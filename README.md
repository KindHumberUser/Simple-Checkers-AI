# Simple-Checkers-AI

Using pygame library for graphics

pip install pygame

python ./main.py (For Windows)

Testing Mode:
  To enter testing mode, input "T" right after running main.py. This will test the advanced AI starting on the red side against the intermediate AI starting on the black side. The test ends when there is a winner and shows how many moves it took to win.
  Note: Testing mode still has some bugs. Do not click on the pygame window and instead just hover over it. Additonally, the game may crash for Mac users in certain rare positions.

Normal Mode:
  Testing mode can be skipped by entering any value other than "T". Now the terminal will prompt some questions to setup the game. Once we enter the game loop, the pygame window should be drawn and you are in the game!
